4. Commit with clear messages
5. Push to your fork
6. Create a Pull Request with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference any related issues

## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React Best Practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use React.memo for performance optimization when needed
- Keep components small and focused

### File Organization
